Project Abstract
Advanced Technology Vehicles (ATV’s), which are electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid cars, are becoming more prevalent in the United States. Many facets were explored to observe the number of ATV sales that occur in the U.S. as a result of economic factors, such as Consumer Price Index or oil price, or whether the availability of car charging stations and the number of models sold by manufacturers has. This project also investigated what manufacturers are leading the automobile industry transition to ATV’s and if those manufacturers can be used to predict the growth of the ATV market in general. State data was used to find which states have the most number of charging stations and would encourage ATV ownership as a result. As time goes on, ATV sales will continue to grow however it is difficult to predict when they will make up a majority of the market share of automobile sales in the U.S. with the amount of data currently available and the number of confounding factors.
